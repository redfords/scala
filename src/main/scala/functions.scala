  // procedures


//  Write a function that computes the area of a circle given its radius.

//  Provide an alternate form of the function in exercise 1 that takes the radius as a
//  String . What happens if your function is invoked with an empty String ?

//  Write a recursive function that prints the values from 5 to 50 by fives, without using
//  for or while loops. Can you make it tail-recursive?

//  Write a function that takes a milliseconds value and returns a string describing the
//  value in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. What’s the optimal type for the input
//  value?

//  Write a function that calculates the first value raised to the exponent of the second
//  value. Try writing this first using math.pow , then with your own calculation. Did
//  you implement it with variables? Is there a solution available that only uses im‐
//  mutable data? Did you choose a numeric type that is large enough for your uses?

//  Write a function that calculates the difference between a pair of 2D points (x and
//  y) and returns the result as a point. Hint: this would be a good use for tuples (see
//  “Tuples” on page 25).

//  Write a function that takes a 2-sized tuple and returns it with the Int value (if
//  included) in the first position. Hint: this would be a good use for type parameters
//  and the isInstanceOf type operation.

//  Write a function that takes a 3-sized tuple and returns a 6-sized tuple, with each
//  original parameter followed by its String representation. For example, invoking
//  the function with (true, 22.25, "yes") should return (true, "true", 22.5,
//  "22.5", "yes", "yes") . Can you ensure that tuples of all possible types are com‐
//  patible with your function? When you invoke this function, can you do so with
//  explicit types not only in the function result but in the value that you use to store
//  the result?
