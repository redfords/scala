//  Given a string name , write a match expression that will return the same string if
//  nonempty, or else the string “n/a” if it is empty

//  Given a double amount , write an expression to return “greater” if it is more than
//  zero, “same” if it equals zero, and “less” if it is less than zero. Can you write this with
//  if..else blocks? How about with match expressions?

//  Write an expression to convert one of the input values cyan , magenta , yellow to
//  their six-char hexadecimal equivalents in string form. What can you do to handle
//  error conditions?

//  Print the numbers 1 to 100, with each line containing a group of five numbers. For
//  example:
//  1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
//  6, 7, 8, 9, 10
//  ....

//  Write an expression to print the numbers from 1 to 100, except that for multiples
//  of 3, print “type,” and for multiples of 5, print “safe.” For multiples of both 3 and 5,
//  print “typesafe.”

//  Can you rewrite the answer to exercise 5 to fit on one line?
